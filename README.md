## Overview

This project integrates advanced AI technologies for financial document management, stock price prediction, and fraud detection. Utilizing Document AI, AutoML, and machine learning models, the system enhances security and efficiency in financial processes, including invoice management, KYC verification, stock market analysis, and transaction monitoring.

## Features

1. **Document Management & KYC Verification**
   - Automated document processing for efficient invoice management.
   - Secure KYC verification to enhance customer onboarding and regulatory compliance.

2. **Stock Price Prediction**
   - Predictive analytics using Yahoo Finance data.
   - Deployed AutoML model specifically trained on Bank of Baroda stock data for forecasting closing prices.

3. **Fraud Detection**
   - Real-time fraud detection using transaction data from a financial payout simulator.
   - Machine learning models to identify anomalies and potential fraudulent activities.

4. **Front-End Interface**
   - Developed using Flutter for a seamless, cross-platform user experience.
   - Interactive UI for accessing document management, stock predictions, and fraud alerts.

## Architecture

The system architecture consists of three primary components:

1. **Document Management System:**
   - *Document AI Module*: Processes invoices and KYC documents.
   - *Data Storage*: Securely stores processed documents.

2. **Stock Prediction System:**
   - *Data Source*: Yahoo Finance API.
   - *Data Processing*: Cleanses and prepares data.
   - *AutoML Model*: Predicts stock prices.
   - *Prediction Endpoint*: Provides real-time stock predictions.

3. **Fraud Detection System:**
   - *Transaction Data Source*: Financial payout simulator.
   - *Data Processing*: Prepares data for anomaly detection.
   - *Anomaly Detection Model*: Identifies unusual transactions.
   - *Fraud Detection Endpoint*: Alerts on potential fraud.

4. **Front-End Application:**
   - *Flutter Framework*: Powers the user interface for various platforms.
   - *User Interaction*: Allows users to view documents, stock predictions, and fraud alerts.
